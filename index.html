                About
            </h1>
            <p>
                I started cake decorating when I was 16, helping my Mom decorate our Christmas cake every year.
            </p>
            <p>
                When family and friends saw the cakes they started asking me to make them cakes of their own, it was then I discovered my love and talent for cake making.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2013 I began studying Baking & Pastry Arts in DIT, to develop my skills in a more formal setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a few years working in bakeries, building my skills and knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I pride myself in creating beautiful cakes suited exactly to your requirements, for any occasion, using only the best quality ingredients.

                Absolutely beautiful cake. It was better that I could of imagined and
                my sister didn't even want to cut into it, because it looked so good.
                We got orange chocolate and raspberry and white choc and it went down a treat.
                Thank you so much Bronagh I will definitely be in touch for the next party.

                Thank you Bronagh for the recent choc biscuit cake you made for Robyn's
                Christening and delivered to my door. It was a perfect match to my Pinterest
                sourced inspiration and tasted delicious! You were a pleasure to deal with
                making it hassle free. I highly recommend Bronagh for any cake needs you have.

            <h2>
                Q) How much do the cakes cost?
            </h2>
            <p>
                There is are no set prices on cakes outside of seasonal offerings
                (ie. Christmas, Valentine's Day), as the price varies greatly from
                cake to cake depending on ingredients, people to feed and detail. 
                Consultations allow me to offer a variety of options catered to 
                your wants and budget. Currently, my Valentine's offering is available.
                6 cupcakes for €12, 12 cupcakes for €20 and share boxes for €25.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How do I place an order?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Simply use the "Contact" section of the website to send me an email and 
                I will contact you to discuss your ideas. While seasonal offerings are on
                you can use this feature to book directly. On both occasions please be mindful
                of the "Calendar" feature on the website. When it indicates I am "fully booked", 
                I am truly fully booked and cannot facilitate an order at this time.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How far in advance should I book?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I would recommend contacting me no later than one month in advance for smaller
                cakes, as there is limited availability and spaces tend to fill up fast. For larger
                cakes, I would recommend contacting me as soon as possible so that I can start
                work on your design and book you in to avoid disappointment.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Is delivery available?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Delivery is available on a case by case basis, if I can facilitate it I can
                deliver straight to your door. I am a one woman operation so occasionally I may
                not have the time, but where I can I will provide delivery to your door/venue.
